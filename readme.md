> "Oh marvelous boy, I loved you in vain, farewell" â€” Ovid, _Metamorphoses_

This code powers an installation piece intended to be run on an iPad using Safari version 15+.

The piece was created in Fall 2021 for the University of Washington course "On the Bias" with instructors Daniela Rosner & Afroditi Psarra.

The code makes liberal use of the p5.js creative coding library as well as the wonderful ml5.js machine learning library intended for artistic use.

The texts generated in the corpus were created using a fine-tuned gpt2 model trained on the discussion posts from the course (~40,000 words).
